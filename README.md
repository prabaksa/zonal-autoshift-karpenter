# zonal-autoshift-karpenter
This is a concept showing how you can use zonal autoshift's integration with EventBridge to automatically remove zones from a Karpenter node pool when an autoshift is underway.

## High level setup instructions
1. Create an EventBridge rule for zonal shift, "Autoshift in progress" events.
2. Configure the rule to send autoshift events to an SNS topic.
3. Create an IAM role for the zonal-autoshift-karpenter pod to assume that allows it to subscribe to the topic. If using IRSA, add the roleArn to the pod's service account. If using Pod Identity, create a pod identity association. 
4. Apply the zonal-autoshift-karpenter deployment.yaml

## TODO

1. If no topology.kubernetes.io/zone key exists, create it, then add the list of unimpared zones as values. Use DescribeCluster to get the current list of eligible subnets/availability zones. If it's an auto-mode cluster and there are no custom node pools, create a new node pool from the general purpose node pool and add the topology.kubeberes.io/zone key and the list of unimpared zones as values.
2. When a zonal shift occurs, and if the topology.kubernetes.io/zone key exists, store the name of the impared zone, e.g. us-west-2a, in a database like DynamoDB before removing it from the list of values. When service is restored (the zonal shift is cancelled or expires), restore the zone to the list of values by reading from the database.
3. Secure the HTTP endpoint for the SNS client that runs in the k8s cluster or, if that's not possible, switch to SQS.
4. Use an Infrastructure as Code tool such as TF or CDK to automate the deployment.
